## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a System Administrator who tries to learn Python programming. In my repositories you can find a few demo programs that I created. Some make more sense, some make less but during the development of each, I developed myself a lot!

## ðŸ›  Skills
Python - this profile is all about it

Powershell - I use it in my daily work

Bash - I use it in my daily work but not as much as powershell
